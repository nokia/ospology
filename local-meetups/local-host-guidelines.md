# TODO Local Host Guidelines

TODO Local Meetups are great ways to learn about new OSPO trends and open source management tooling. If there's not one in your area, it's easy to start one.

This document serves as a guide for a TODO Local Host when setting up an OSPO Meetup within their region.

## Planning the OSPO Meetup

* Check if there's already an OSPO Meetup in your area
* Open a new [GH Discussion under OSPOlogy repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions), indicating the desired location and how the creation of this meetup can benefit the OSPO Community
* Wait for TODO Program Manager to (1) open the new OSPO Local Meetup via LF Online Community Platform and (2) give you organizer permissions
* Start promoting your event via [Linux Foundation’s Online Community platform](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/), as well as on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other local outlets.
* You can also promote on TODO Slack / Community mailing list


## Commitment

Being promoted as TODO Local host means:

* You understand OSPO Local meetups powered by the TODO Group are committed to vendor neutrality and aim to become a forum for like-minded professionals to share knowledge and experiences on OSPO.
* You do not use an OSPO Meetup with the main goal of having discussions designed to generate sales for a vendor.
* You meet TODO Local Host's [requirements](#local-host-requirements-and-responsibilities)
* You take care of TODO Local Host's [responsibilities](#local-host-requirements-and-responsibilities)
